üöÄ Intelligent Image Classification & Robotic Navigation System

üìñ Introduction
This project integrates Image Classification using TensorFlow's Inception Model and Robotic Orientation Control using ROS (Robot Operating System). It can classify objects in an image, process results, and align a robot's orientation towards a specified target object.

The system combines:

Machine Learning (Object Classification)
Data Processing (CSV Manipulation)
Robotics (Angular Navigation with ROS)
Whether you're a researcher, student, or tech enthusiast, this project aims to simplify complex AI-robotics integration.

üåü Project Overview

Object Detection and Classification:

Classifies objects in an image using the Inception model.
Stores predictions in a CSV file.

Data Processing:
Cleans and processes the CSV data to extract relevant information.

Robot Navigation:
Adjusts a robot's orientation towards a target object based on classification results.

üìù Scripts Breakdown

üìå 1. Image Classification Script (image_classification.py)

Purpose:
Classifies objects in a given image using TensorFlow's pre-trained Inception model and logs predictions into a CSV file.

Model Download & Setup:
Downloads the Inception model if not already present.

Inference Process:

Loads the model.
Processes the input image.
Outputs top predictions and writes them to a Predictions.csv file.

ROS Integration:

Subscribes to /rpy_angles for orientation data.
Logs yaw angles during image classification.

How to Run:
python image_classification.py --image_path=path_to_your_image.jpg

Expected Output:

Object predictions displayed on the terminal.
Predictions.csv file created with object names and their scores.

üìå 2. CSV Data Cleaning Script (csv_cleaner.py)

Purpose:
Processes the raw Predictions.csv file to clean and extract meaningful data.

Empty Row Removal:
Removes any blank or invalid rows from Predictions.csv.

Column Filtering:
Keeps only the required columns.

Output File:
Creates a clean FilteredData.csv file.

How to Run:

python csv_cleaner.py
Expected Output:

A clean FilteredData.csv file ready for the robot navigation script.

üìå 3. Robot Orientation Script (robot_orientation.py)

Purpose:
Controls a robot's yaw (angular rotation) based on the classified target object from FilteredData.csv.

Read Target Object:
Extracts the target object's yaw position from FilteredData.csv.

Orientation Adjustment:

Subscribes to /rpy_angles to receive live yaw updates.
Publishes angular velocity commands to align the robot towards the target.

How to Run:

roscore  # Start ROS core (if not already running)
python robot_orientation.py

Expected Output:
Robot rotates to align with the target object's yaw angle.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
ROS (Robot Operating System)
NumPy
Pandas
Install Dependencies:

pip install tensorflow numpy pandas rospy

Step 1: Run Image Classification Script
python image_classification.py --image_path=path_to_image.jpg

Step 2: Clean the CSV Data
python csv_cleaner.py

Step 3: Start ROS Core
roscore

Step 4: Run Robot Orientation Script
python robot_orientation.py

üîÑ Workflow Explained

Image Classification:

Input an image and run the classification script.
Predictions are saved to Predictions.csv.

Data Processing:
Clean and refine prediction data into FilteredData.csv.

Robot Navigation:

Robot receives the target yaw position from the clean CSV.
Robot aligns itself with the target object.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

TensorFlow Import Errors:
Ensure TensorFlow is installed and matches your Python version.

CSV File Missing:
Verify that the scripts are executed in the correct order.

Robot Not Rotating:
Check if /rpy_angles topic is publishing yaw data.

üöÄ Future Improvements

Add real-time image classification with a live camera feed.
Implement advanced robotics maneuvers.
Improve object detection accuracy using fine-tuned models.
